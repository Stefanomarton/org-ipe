* ORG-IPE

Several years ago I was impressed with this [[https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/][post]] from Gilles Castel, but personally I find Inkscape too much
for what I need. I discover [[https://github.com/otfried/ipe][ipe]] a short time ago.

This org package offer the ability to create and modify drawing with IPE, that is obviously a dependency.

I usually export my document with org-latex backend, in order to correctly export ~svg~ you must include:

#+begin_src org
#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[inkscapelatex=false]{svg} 
#+end_src

and then make sure that you have ~-shell-escape~ in your ~org-latex-pdf-process~ command. Like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-latex-pdf-process
      '("pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
        "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+end_src
